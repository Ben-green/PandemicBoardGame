## What is this?

This is a simple project I've started to help me learn how to use vim, Python and Github. When it's finished it should let somebody play the Pandemic board game as one or more of the characters.

I'm about to start an OU degree in computing and IT and hoping for a career in IT eventually. The role I've got my eye on is one of full stack developer:

>The term full-stack means developers who are comfortable working with
both back-end and front-end technologies. To be more specific, it means
that the developer can work with databases, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
and everything in between ... --

although I understand this might already be old hat

>It seems as though everyone in tech today is infatuated with the full-stack
developer. Full stack may have been possible in the Web 2.0 era, but a new
generation of startups is emerging, pushing the limits of virtually all
areas of software. --

So I'm going to try to learn as much code as I can and focus on completing practical fun projects with other people alongside my course. 

## How to run the code

I'm trying to use _test first development_ where I write the tests before I write the actual code. To run the tests use the command:

`python -m unittest t_makeboard`  
or  
`python -m unittest nameoftests`

## What am I trying to learn?

I'd like to get my head round:

* git,
* Python,
* SQL,
* the unix shell in Ubuntu,
* all else relevant to make this work.

In the future I'd also like to learn

At least one kind of web server language, probably two (Apache, PHP I think)
At least one version of SQL
Some basic front end website languages (HTML, JavaScript and the like)
