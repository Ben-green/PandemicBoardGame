**How is this going to work?**

So I think I need a plan of how I'm going to work this whole thing out. Once I've got this I can create the tests, as right now everything feels a bit directionless.

**Step 1 - Set Up of the game**

At the end of set up 4 tables should exist (5 if the discard for tables 2 and 3 are included)

1 - boardTBL with all the board information
2 - shuf with all the cards left in the player deck after hands have been drawn
3 - infection deck with all the cards in the infection deck
4 - game state table, with the state of the game info included

tables should also exist for each player, giving them the cards in their hands.


**Step 2 - Playing the game**

Not sure how to do this yet.

**Step 3 - Checking to see if the game has been won or lost**

Ditto on this.
